--- Missing Values Check¶

SELECT * FROM store_values
WHERE units_sold IS NULL

--- Out of Range Values¶

SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE (age < 0) AND (age > 40)
SELECT * FROM store_sales
WHERE employee_shift > 10 OR
employee_shift < 0

--- Ordering and Counting

SELECT age FROM employees
ORDER BY age
SELECT age FROM employees
ORDER BY age DESC
SELECT age, start_date FROM employees
ORDER BY age, start_date
SELECT COUNT(age) FROM employees # return non null values

--- Calculating correlation with SQL

-1: negatively correlated
+1: positively correlated
0: not correlated

-- positively correlated
SELECT CORR(units_sold, total_revenue)
FROM product_sales
-- negatively correlated
SELECT CORR(rooms_booked, rooms_avaliable)
FROM hotel_rooms
--not correlated
SELECT CORR(distance_to_store, amount_spend)
FROM hotel_rooms
